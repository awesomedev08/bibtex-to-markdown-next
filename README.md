## Prerequisites

1. Install [Python 3.11+](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) if it‚Äôs not already installed

## Installation

Open your Terminal or Command Prompt app and install the Academic CLI tool:

    pip3 install -U academic
    
Or, help test the latest development version:

    pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/wowchemy/hugo-academic-cli.git

## Usage

Download references from your reference manager, such as Zotero, in the Bibtex format.

Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder containing your Bibtex file:

    cd <MY_BIBTEX_FOLDER>

**Import publications:**

Say we downloaded our publications from our reference manager, such as Zotero, to a file named `my_publications.bib` within the website folder. We can import them into the default `content/publication/` folder with:

    academic import --bibtex my_publications.bib

**Import publications to a specific folder (e.g. `content/zh/publication`):**

Say our site has multiple languages, we may want to output the publications to a specific folder with:

    academic import --bibtex my_publications.bib --publication-dir content/zh/publication/

Optional arguments:

* `--publication-dir PUBLICATION_DIR` Folder to import publications to (defaults to `content/publication`)
* `--overwrite` Overwrite any existing publications in the output folder
* `--normalize` Normalize tags by converting them to lowercase and capitalizing the first letter (e.g. "sciEnCE" -> "Science")
* `--featured` Flag these publications as *featured* (to appear in *Featured Publications* widget)
* `--verbose` or `-v` Show verbose messages
* `--help` Help
